# Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution

This repository contains an implementation based on the paper **"Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"** by Johnson, Alahi, and Fei-Fei. The approach leverages feed-forward transformation networks trained with perceptual loss functions computed via a fixed, pretrained convolutional network (typically VGG-16) to enable fast and high-quality artistic style transfer and super-resolution.
