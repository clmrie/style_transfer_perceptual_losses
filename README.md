# Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution

This repository contains an implementation based on the paper **"Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"** by Johnson, Alahi, and Fei-Fei. The approach leverages feed-forward transformation networks trained with perceptual loss functions computed via a fixed, pretrained convolutional network (typically VGG-16) to enable fast and high-quality artistic style transfer and super-resolution.

## Features

- **Real-Time Style Transfer**: Apply artistic styles to images in a single forward pass, achieving results comparable to optimization-based methods at a fraction of the computation time.
- **Single-Image Super-Resolution**: Enhance low-resolution images by reconstructing fine details and textures using perceptual losses.
- **Perceptual Loss Functions**: Implement feature reconstruction and style reconstruction losses based on high-level VGG features.
- **Fully Convolutional Architecture**: Process images of arbitrary sizes at test-time due to the network’s fully convolutional design.

```

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.6+
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch (or Torch if you adapt the original Torch implementation)
- **CUDA:** (if using GPU acceleration)
- **Additional Libraries:** numpy, pillow, matplotlib, etc.

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

1. **Configure Parameters:**  
   Edit `config/config.yaml` to set the desired hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, loss weights, etc.) and other paths.

2. **Start Training:**  
   Run the main entry point in training mode:
   ```bash
   python main.py --mode train
   ```

   This script will initialize the data loaders, build the transformation network and loss network, and then execute the training loop.

### Inference

To apply the trained model to new images:

```bash
python main.py --mode test --input_path path/to/input_image.jpg --output_path path/to/output_image.jpg
```

This command uses the feed-forward network to generate a transformed output (for style transfer or super-resolution) in a single forward pass.

### Evaluation

To evaluate model performance and compute metrics, use the evaluation scripts in the `training/` directory:

```bash
python training/evaluate.py --dataset path/to/test_dataset
```

## Configuration

All configurations including hyperparameters and file paths are managed via the `config/config.yaml` file. This centralizes experiment settings, making it easy to reproduce or modify experiments.
